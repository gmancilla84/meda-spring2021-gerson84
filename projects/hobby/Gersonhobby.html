        <h1>I am a Sneakerhead!</h1>

        <p>My Name is Gerson Mancilla. I am 36 years old and I was born and raised in San Francisco. My hobby is different from most I suppose, my hobby is collecting sneakers(sneaker head)!  I like my hobby because I have always been into style and for me style starts with the shoes. I have always been into the different styles, colors and shapes shoes come in. It is not just one style of shoe that I like, I like them all from basketball shoes, running shoes, to skateboarding shoes.</p>

        <p>What does it mean to be a sneakerhead? A sneakerhead is someone who collects, trades and or admires sneakers as a hobby. Generally, sneakerheads are well-versed in the history of sneakers and study the market carefully. If you present them with a pair of sneakers, they can tell you their value, make and history. </p>
